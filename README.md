# JsParty 1 planning

This repo is for planning hopefully the first of a number of JavaScript get-togethers

## What

JsParty is aimed to be a multi-day lan-party style event for developers to be able to come together,
hack on something interesting in a relaxed, 'party-like' atmosphere.

The event will likely be held on a weekend, starting on a Friday night, and ending midday sunday.

It will be hosted in a large open area, somewhere in brisbane city, close to hotels/bars etc, with great internet.

Alcohol will be present, which may influence the minimum age that will be able to attend.

There will be no officially pre-arranged talks/workshops, but anyone with an interest in teaming up to learn
something new or work on something together are very encouraged to do so.

## When

TBA, based on interest and other events around the same time.

## Where

Somewhere in Brisbane. This allows for ease of transport, good infrastructure, and a wide range of accomodation options.
